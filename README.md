# Apache Airflow
================

This is a fork of [Airflow 1.10.15](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/1.10.15)

## Changes in our fork

- Fix scheduler bug that only allowed running 1 task at a time per DAG due to wrong batch commit
- Hide `Delete` and `Trigger Dag` buttons from the DAG UI
- Hide `Delete` button from the main Airflow page
- Fix `bail.` button onclick action to redirect correctly to the DAG page
- Fix too many notifications bug that would call the on failure notification callback on every scheduler loop https://github.com/github/airflow-sources/issues/2712
- Fix logging error where the Subprocess would write the logs into the console instead of to the worker log file. [Associated commit](https://github.com/github/incubator-airflow/commit/e8e19f2b44449e8ad5f2943500f6613ba9d72317). This aims to fix the bug described in the Open Source Jira board [1](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-7030) and [2](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6904).
- Introduced legacy `get_conn` in `GoogleCloudStorageHook`, to make it backwards compatible with some Operators of `airflow-sources` (specifically, the method `_get_gcs_blob_media_request` from `GCSToHDFSOperator`). [Associated commit](https://github.com/github/incubator-airflow/commit/febd45431b315794dbfacbbf4142818c2d959feb)
- Propagated improved colours everywhere.
